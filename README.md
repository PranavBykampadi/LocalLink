# Predicting residential wind turbine output
In the face of the pressing global challenge posed by climate change and the imperative to transition towards sustainable energy sources, this research delves into the uncharted territory of residential wind energy generation. While renewable energy has made substantial strides on an industrial scale, its integration into residential areas remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we present an innovative approach utilizing machine learning models for the accurate prediction of wind energy output in residential settings. This research, which encompasses both instantaneous prediction and forecasting models, harnesses a rich dataset obtained from a commercial wind turbine and incorporates theoretical power curve values as a parameter. Our investigation encompasses Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, and an LSTM Neural Network. The results highlight the potential of these models to empower individuals with insights into the feasibility and benefits of residential wind energy systems, ultimately fostering a shift towards sustainable energy consumption at the grassroots level. We thus aim to make clean energy more accessible through our research. Furthermore, this research contributes to the broader discourse on renewable energy adoption, offering a practical pathway for harnessing the power of the wind to mitigate environmental degradation and combat the climate crisis.
